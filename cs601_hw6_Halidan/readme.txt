a. What I add to this week?
This week I am mainly focus on use VUE, first I used v-model in input(checkbox), it can directive to create two-way data bindings on form input,
and then multiple checkboxes, bound to the same array. Secondly, I created an array as a data which stores four image path binding to mousehover event.

b.How do I run the program?
a. First youshould unzip the file, and then you can use broswer like chrome or firfox and ect. to open the index.html, then the program can be running.
b. Because ES6 is used, opening directly from the index may have some errors (CORS policy) or incomplete page display. 
So I hosted this project on github and put the link on the page, so you only need to open index.html and click on the link.
c. You can directly vist my page from this link: https://monica-bu.github.io/cs601_hw6_Halidan/
