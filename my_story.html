        <p> My undergraduate major is Chinese language and literature, but I found that I like children very much and
          also like mathematics, so after graduation, I chose to be a math teacher.I worked as a math teacher for three
          years from 2015 to 2018.I really enjoyed my time as a teacher. I enjoyed the innocence and kindness of
          children and the joy of sharing knowledge. Of course, I have also gained the love of many children, and we
          have kept in touch until now, and I have been watching their growth. Of course, I also hope that the computer
          knowledge I have learned now can be used in the field of education.</p>

      <p>I came to San Jose university to study English, where I have seen a lot of things that I have not been exposed
        to before. Here I also met friends from different countries, they are from Mexico, South Korea, Japan, India,
        Turkey, Spain. I really gained a lot here, including getting married with my boyfriend here. This is where I
        want to live again.</p>
