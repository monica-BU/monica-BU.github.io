a. What I add to this week?
This week's task is using HTML, CSS and Javascript to build a validator. I created an HTML file, a CSS file, and a js file,
those files work together to build validator. I use CSS to make the whole page looks like beautiful, and then use HTML form to bring input, there are three types of input-text,radio and checkbox. 
 By using if/else in function in javascript the input value can be validate.

b.How do I run the program?
First youshould unzip the file, and then you can use broswer like chrome or firfox and ect. to open the index.html, then the program can be running.
