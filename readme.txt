a. What I add to this week?
The first thing I did this week was to create an JOSN file which contains my undergradute and graduate information.
Then I creat a Javascript to create a fetch request to return a promise, resolve the promise using the Response class
check the status code of the response and process the returned JSON data.


b.How do I run the program?
A: First youshould unzip the file, and then you can use broswer like chrome or firfox and ect. to open the index.html, then the program can be running.
B: You can directly access https://monica-bu.github.io
